# Data Wrangling
## Acquisation and Cleaning the dataset for analysis
### Data Cleaning plays an essential role. Data Cleaning is the process of retaining only the crucial information from the output so that only relevant features are sent as input to the machine learning model.
### Some common techniques used for data cleaning include identifying and handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting inconsistent values, and handling outliers.
## Creating a Basic Data Cleaning Pipeline in Python

## Loading the CSV file: # The CSV file is loaded as a data frame using the pandas module in Python.
## Preprocessing the Data: # The data has multiple attributes and mostly these are not in a format that Machine Learning modules can understand. Hence following key preprocessing steps can be applied:
## Removing duplicates: # Duplicate rows in a dataset can cause errors or bias in analysis, so it’s important to remove them.
## Correcting inconsistent data: # Inconsistent data can arise due to errors in data entry or data integration. 
## Handling outliers: # Outliers can skew analysis, so it’s important to handle them appropriately. 
## Formatting data: # Data may need to be formatted to meet the requirements of the analysis. 
## Handling missing values: # Missing values can cause problems with analysis, so it’s important to handle them appropriately. Here’s an example of how to handle missing values using the pandas library in Python:
